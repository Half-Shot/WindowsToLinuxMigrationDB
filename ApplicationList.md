###Helpful Notes
```
Wine is much better than the public opinion. They
recently made it to stable 1.7 which makes lots of programs
run almost natively. Check the WineDB before giving up ;)
 
Archive formats are provided by most good distros via File-Roller (e.g ubuntu) or Ark(e.g KDE)
```


###Applications that qualify to be listed as Windows-Only
 * Do not support linux (by support it means all major distros)
 * Planning to support but not yet (likely a beta will follow substandard to the windows alterative)
 * Applications that once supported linux but havn't updated the code/binaries for linux within a good amount of time

##Applications


###Browsers
<a id="browsers"></a>
For the most part browsers work exactly like the ones found on Windows.
Chromium is a less-feature rich but more stable verion of chrome which is open source.
  
###Wine
<a id="wine"></a>
Wine stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator; Simply put, it means that you can fake a windows system to the
application which then converts that to something linux can understand. But as with all software there
is no 100% compatibility and wine at its currrent state (1.7) is better at older apps than newer ones.
Check the Wine [AppDB](http://appdb.winehq.org/) for more info on this.
