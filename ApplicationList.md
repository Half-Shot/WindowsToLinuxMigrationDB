###Helpful Notes
```
Wine is much better than the public opinion. They
recently made it to stable 1.7 which makes lots of programs
run almost natively. Check the WineDB before giving up ;)
 
Archive formats are provided by most good distros via File-Roller (e.g ubuntu) or Ark(e.g KDE)
```

##Applications


###Browsers
<a id="browsers"></a>
For the most part browsers work exactly like the ones found on Windows.
Chromium is a less-feature rich but more stable verion of chrome which is open source.
