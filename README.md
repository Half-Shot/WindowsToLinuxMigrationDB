WindowsToLinuxMigrationDB
=========================

A helpful list of application alternatives provided by me and the Steam Linux Community.


One of Linux's biggest advantages is that it has so many alteratives for the same thing and its hard to find the right one
if your migrating from Windows. This list is intended to ease the process by providing a list to help find your application.

How to help
===========

Just edit the ApplicationList.md (github will fork it for you) and you can push it back to this one.
Lets help show people that letting go of Windows programs can be easier and better in most cases.
